## Implementation Details

### Frontend Architecture (ASP.NET MVC)

The frontend will follow the Model-View-Controller pattern with:

- **Models**: Data structures representing business entities
- **Views**: Razor templates for UI rendering
- **Controllers**: Business logic handlers and view coordination

Key libraries and frameworks:
- Tabulator for grid views
- Leaflet.js for maps
- Chart.js for data visualization
- SignalR for real-time updates
- Bootstrap for responsive design

### Backend Architecture (PostgreSQL)

The database design will focus on:
- Normalization for data integrity
- Denormalization where needed for performance
- Partitioning for high-volume data (telemetry)
- JSON data types for flexible metadata storage
- Spatial data types for geolocation

### API Architecture (GoLang)

The API will be built with:
- RESTful design principles
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting
- Caching strategies
- Microservices approach for scalability
- gRPC for internal service communication
- REST for external clients

## Security Considerations

- Secure authentication with MFA
- HTTPS for all communications
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with relevant data protection regulations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection)

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling for API services
- Database read replicas
- Caching strategies
- Asynchronous processing for reports
- Data archiving strategy
- CDN for static assets

## Questions and Considerations

Before implementation, the following aspects need clarification:
1. Expected number of vehicles to be tracked
2. Frequency of GPS updates required
3. Data retention requirements
4. Integration with existing systems (accounting, ERP, etc.)
5. Specific regulatory compliance requirements
6. Device/GPS hardware specifications
7. Deployment environment details
8. Authentication requirements (SSO, etc.)
9. Specific reporting and analytics requirements
10. Backup and disaster recovery expectations
