# Fleet Tracking Application - Technical Architecture

## System Architecture Overview

The Fleet Tracking Application is designed using a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns between the frontend, backend database, and API layer. This document outlines the technical architecture and how these components interact.

   - `driver_behavior`: Driver behavior metrics
   - `performance_metrics`: Vehicle performance data

5. **Configuration Tables**
   - `system_settings`: Application configuration
   - `user_preferences`: User-specific settings
   - `geo_zones`: Defined geographical areas
   - `alert_configurations`: Alert settings

#### Database Features:

- PostGIS extension for spatial data handling

   - `/api/active-trips`: Real-time trip tracking
   - `/api/trip-history`: Historical trip data

4. **Tracking and Telemetry**
   - `/api/gps`: GPS data handling
   - `/api/telemetry`: General telemetry data
   - `/api/geofence`: Geofencing operations

5. **Analytics and Reporting**
