Generate the project outline in a separate markdown file inside of docs folder. First think what you are going to do and split the complete development into multiple tasks and document those in a saperate markdown file which devides development into frontend, backend and API's. 

I want this to be the Tech Stack
- Frontend in ASP.net MVC
- Backend in PostgresSQL
- API in GoLang

DO NOT DEVELOP ANYTHING UNTIL I TELL YOU TO DEVELOP. JUST GIVE ME PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND YOUR PLANNING OF HOW TO TACKLE THE IMPLEMENTATION. 
AND ALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION MAKE SURE TO ASK IT BEFORE YOU START THE IMPLEMENTATION
