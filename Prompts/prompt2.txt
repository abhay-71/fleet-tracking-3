Please make sure and analyse the codebase that you have sucessfully completed with all the implementation tasks from phase 2 of @detailed_task_breakdown.md and if there are any errors from phase 2 do correct it before moving on to the implementation of phase 3 of the@detailed_task_breakdown.md . Please stop after you have completed with development of phase 3 of the@detailed_task_breakdown.md. Dont forget to add a "X" after you complete the tasks and subtasks of Phase 3 in @detailed_task_breakdown.md .DO NOT START WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHASE 4
-----------------------------------------
Please make sure that you have started with implementation of phase 4, analyse the codebase and resume the implementation from phase 4 of @detailed_task_breakdown.md and if there are any errors from incomplete implementation of phase 4 do correct it before moving on to the implementation of remaining parts of phase 4 of the @detailed_task_breakdown.md. Please stop after you have completed with development of phase 4 of the@detailed_task_breakdown.md. Donâ€™t forget to add a "X" after you complete the tasks and subtasks of Phase 4 in @detailed_task_breakdown.md .DO NOT START WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHASE 5
------------------------------------------
You are working on the implementation of phase 4, analyse the codebase and add a "X" in @detailed_task_breakdown.md for the tasks you complete of Phase 4
