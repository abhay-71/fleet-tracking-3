Let us start with implementation of phase 1 from @technical_architecture.md . I've already created a github repo and we are inside the main branch of that repo. Be sure to go through @docs folder and all the files inside it to understand what are we trying to build. STOP AFTER DEVELOPMENT OF PHASE 1 AND DO NOT START WITH DEVELOPMENT OF PHASE 2 UNTIL I TELL YOU TO START. ALSO DONT FORGET TO ADD A "X" MARK TO THE TASKS AND SUBTASKS THAT ARE COMPLETED
